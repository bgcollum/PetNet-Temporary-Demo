This repository is a temporary upload of the PetNet project.
The PetNet project ran from August 2022 through May of 2023.
PetNet was developed as a closed-source project, with the intent of open-sourcing its contents upon release.
Now that the PetNet project has been completed, the original repository is awaiting a visibility update, and until that time this temporary repository will be available for viewing.

[PetNet proposal and design documentation can be viewed here](https://github.com/bgcollum/PetNet-Temporary-Demo/blob/main/PetNetProposal.pdf)
